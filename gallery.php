I provided a layout plan, heavily refined the content and designed with a stainless steel refrigerator in mind. I coded using HTML5 and CSS3 and designed in Photoshop. It's due for an update in 2015.

I chose space and movies, naturally leading to Space Movie.<br/><br/>The design was built around an image for the game Starcraft 2. I pulled colors from the image and used Impact as the decorative typeface.<br/><br/>Once the layout was decided upon, I used an existing image and pictures of a night-light in my apartment to create space ships firing at a driver.

I used photographs of my Calvin and Hobbes collection as graphics.<br/><br/>Some interesting aspects were using macro shots of the comics to create depth in an otherwise 2D image, and using Hobbes' body to help eye flow.

            <img src="img/images_gallery/09.png" title="Helvetica Article for the Santa Fe College DMT Program<br><small></small>" alt="Adobe Photoshop CS5, Adobe InDesign CS5<br/><br/>The goal was to design a magazine layout based on the font Helvetica.<br/><br/>NASA's Space Shuttle is a recognizable icon of the United States, so replacing 'United States' with 'Helvetica' gives us with a potent delivery of the article's subject. It also depicts the large and subtle role the typeface plays in our lives. The photo (credit unknown) was adjusted for color and the quote doubles as a lead-in to the actual article.

The project took about 30 minutes from start to finish, which at that time was a milestone in trusting my own instincts.

The broken rule went through the critique completely unnoticed (in printed form) and the design was regarded as a success.

I converted the center of the speaker to a globe, placed the antenna in the middle and used a lightning for the lightning. The metal texture of the letters comes from a penny.
