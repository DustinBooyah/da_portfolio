            <img src="img/img_gallery/22.png" title="Brinkman Surveying" alt="Adobe CS6 (Illustrator, Photoshop, Fireworks) Notepad ++, Firebug<br/><br/>Brinkman Surveying is a small project that allows users to request quotes from the company online. The back end is still being built.<br/><br/>I used large photos and text to convey the simple purpose of the site. The background of the inner pages is an actual survey map.

This charity is for keeping teachers and students engaged with music in school.

I designed the initial logo, mockups and graphics implemented throughout.I also did stationary in Illustrator and Photoshop.<br/><br/>The description of the logo can be seen in the photograph, while examples of the stationary can be found on Behance.

I provided a layout plan, heavily refined the content and designed with a stainless steel refrigerator in mind. I coded using HTML5 and CSS3 and designed in Photoshop. It's due for an update in 2015.

            <img src="img/img_gallery/01.png" title="Space Movie for 352 Media Group" alt="Mockup<br/>Adobe Fireworks CS5, Adobe Photoshop CS5<br/><br/>The first design project during my internship at 352 was to design a website for what inspires me. I chose space and movies, naturally leading to Space Movie.<br/><br/>The design was built around an image for the game Starcraft 2. I pulled colors from the image and used Impact as the decorative typeface.<br/><br/>Once the layout was decided upon, I used an existing image and pictures of a night-light in my apartment to create space ships firing at a driver.

I used photographs of my Calvin and Hobbes collection as graphics.<br/><br/>Some interesting aspects were using macro shots of the comics to create depth in an otherwise 2D image, and using Hobbes' body to help eye flow.

            <img src="img/img_gallery/09.png" title="Helvetica Article for the Santa Fe College DMT Program" alt="Adobe Photoshop CS5, Adobe InDesign CS5<br/><br/>The goal was to design a magazine layout based on the font Helvetica.<br/><br/>NASA's Space Shuttle is a recognizable icon of the United States, so replacing 'United States' with 'Helvetica' gives us with a potent delivery of the article's subject. It also depicts the large and subtle role the typeface plays in our lives. The photo (credit unknown) was adjusted for color and the quote doubles as a lead-in to the actual article.

            <img src="img/img_gallery/17.png" title="Cerwin Vega magazine insert for the Santa Fe College DMT Program" alt="Adobe Photoshop CS5, Printed<br/><br/>I created and printed a small (unofficial) ad for the speaker company Cerwin-Vega. The project took about 30 minutes from start to finish, which at that time was a milestone in trusting my own instincts.

Several of the icons in the dock are custom as well, as is the entire Windows theme.

            <img src="img/img_gallery/04.png" title="Character project for the Santa Fe College DMT Program" alt=" Printed<br/><br/>Adobe Illustrator CS5<br/><br/>This poster depicts two fonts and two letters: Century Gothic and Courier with Y & X, respectively.<br/><br/>I deliberately ignored a 'rule of thumb' about placing text on top of text.  The broken rule went through the critique completely unnoticed (in printed form) and the design was regarded as a success.

This design was a finalist in the competition and I still use elements from this project for mockup / layout design.

            <img src="img/img_gallery/10.png" title="Planet Power radio station logo for the Digital Media Technology program at Santa Fe College" alt="Adobe After Effects CS5, Adobe Illustrator CS5<br/><br/>In class, we collectively came up with elements that could possibly be in a radio station's logo: Globe, antenna, lightning, speakers and a shield.<br/><br/>I didn't want to use an actual shield because they make me think of Anti-Virus scams so I used a Flying V and a guitar pick to mimic the shape. I converted the center of the speaker to a globe, placed the antenna in the middle and used a lightning for the lightning. The metal texture of the letters comes from a penny.
